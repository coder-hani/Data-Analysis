# Data Analysis 

## Overview
This project focuses on performing a comprehensive data analysis using Python on two distinct datasets:
1. **Agricultural Lands in Algeria**: This dataset contains information about agricultural lands in Algeria, including data on types of crops, land area, irrigation practices, and more.
2. **COVID-19 Data**: This dataset contains information on COVID-19, such as daily case numbers, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates.

The analysis involves statistical measures, data cleaning, normalization, and data visualization.

## Prerequisites
To run the analysis, ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Statistical Analysis

This step computes basic statistical insights from both datasets.

#### Features:
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in each column.
- **Median**: The middle value in the dataset for numerical columns.
- **Average**: The mean value for each numerical column.
- **Total Number of Nulls**: Counts the number of missing values in each column.
- **Percentage of Null Values**: Calculates the percentage of missing values in each column relative to the total number of rows.

### 2. Data Cleaning

This step ensures the datasets are properly formatted and free of errors or inconsistencies.

#### Features:
- **Date Formatting**: Ensures that any date columns are properly converted to a standard date format.
- **Convert Columns to Appropriate Data Types**: Converts the data types of columns as necessary (e.g., from string to numeric, or from numeric to date).
- **Check for Missing Values**: Identifies missing values and handles them, either by removing the rows/columns with too many missing values or filling them with an appropriate value (such as the mean, median, or mode).

### 3. Data Normalization

This step normalizes the datasets to ensure consistency across numerical data, making them easier to analyze and compare.

#### Features:
- **Min-Max Normalization**: Scales numerical data to fall between 0 and 1.
- **Standardization**: Transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Binning with Equal Values**: Divides numerical data into a fixed number of bins with equal widths.
- **Binning with Frequent Values**: Groups data into bins based on the frequency of values.

### 4. Data Visualization

This step generates visual representations of the data for better understanding and insight, particularly for the COVID-19 dataset.

#### Features:
- **Load all files starting with "COVID"**: Automatically identifies and processes all files related to COVID-19.
- **Plotting**: Produces a variety of charts and graphs such as histograms, bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to visualize trends and distributions.
